# GBBAT 

## Goal
Began research by writing a practice paper for the Data Science Journal on our creation of GBBAT.

The editor Mark Parsons suggested that the following makes a good practice paper.

>  A useful practice paper needs to say a bit more than a description of the event, tool, or practice. It should provide some insight or lessons learned. What is the message we should take from the experience? Are there clear demonstrated design principles that can be reapplied elsewhere? Are there roadblocks or bottlenecks that others might avoid? Are there suggested community or work practices that can make things smoother?

The Data Science Journal describes practice papers as: 

> Practice papers should report upon or critique a specific "happening" such as a release of a major study or other notable occurrence related to the journal focus. Authors interested in submitting a practice paper should discuss the content with the editor before submitting a manuscript. Practice papers should describe the finished outputs of a project, or the procedures in operation in an established data system. Practice papers should be no longer than 3,000 words in length.

However, the scope of the research is broader.

## Latex
We write the article in Latex, `gbbat_manuscript.tex`

Our bibliography will be compiled within Mendeley. When we add new sources to Mendeley, we need to export a new .bib file
into our repo to replace the current bibliography file (`gbbat_references.bib`).
